# OS-Project
The project aims to provide a flexible and extensible simulation tool for studying and comparing the performance of multitasking scheduling algorithms. The main objectives are as follows:

* Generate random tasks with diverse characteristics (execution time, priorities, arrival times).
* Implement multiple multitasking scheduling algorithms.
* Allow for the configuration of simulation parameters, including the number of tasks, arrival intervals, scheduling parameters, etc.
* Collect data on task execution and algorithm performance metrics.
* Visualize the simulation results in the form of graphs and statistics.
